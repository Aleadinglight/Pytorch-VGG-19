# Pytorch-VGG-19
Using Pytorch to implement VGG-19

## Instruction

Implementation and notes can be found [here](https://github.com/Aleadinglight/Pytorch-VGG-19/blob/master/VGG_19.ipynb).

This is an implementation of this [paper](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf) in Pytorch. 

This one was wrote using important ideas from Pytorch tutorial. I did my best to explain in detail the ideas in each section of the Python notebook. The maths and visual illustation can be found below.
